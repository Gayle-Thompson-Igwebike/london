# Who am I?

I am a mother, a wife, and a Software Engineer.
I came from Brazil and graduated in Computer Science.  
I have been working as Software Engineer for more than 14 years and I am still in love with this career.

I worked for several years as a full-stack engineer.
In the last 6 years, I was focused on the backend which I found to be my passion.
