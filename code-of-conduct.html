                <li><em>WWCode is an inclusive community</em>, dedicated to providing an empowering experience for everyone who participates in or supports our community, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, socioeconomic status, caste, creed, political affiliation, or preferred programming language(s).</li>
                <li>Cancel or reschedule appointments with a minimum of 24 hours prior notice by providing a reason using preferable channel (email, slack, or anything else you both chose as the channel of communication) to the mentor.</li>
                <li>No-shows are unacceptable for mentors and mentees. No-shows should be informed to the Mentorship Programme Team by <a href="mailto:wwcodelondon.mentorship@gmail.com">email</a>.

                <li>No-replies by email or slack to the Mentorship Programme Team and/or mentor in a week are unacceptable during the program. Participants who applied but failed to reply without any reason provided will be banned from the current cycle.</li>
